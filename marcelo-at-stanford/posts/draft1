 
Run "cmd.exe" as a given user and "as administrator" in command line
Hello and thank you for reading my post.


 

If I'm logged in Windows as user "u1", I can execute "cmd.exe" "as administrator" by choosing
Code:
 "Start" -> "cmd.exe" and right-click "Run as administrator".
I would like to start another "cmd.exe" console as "u2" and "as administrator".
(So, "u2" is not the current logged in user).

The following command:
Code:
u1 cmd.exe> runas /user:u2 "cmd.exe"
runs "cmd.exe" as "u2" but not "as administrator".

I would like to do this in command line. Can you tell me how?
