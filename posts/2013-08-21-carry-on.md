Title: Carry On...

Summary: My last post @ Stanford

I guess this is my last post on this site.

It is with a tightened heart and a saddened mind that I decided to leave Stanford to pursue other opportunities...

These past 5+ years were great, and I cant deny how fruitful they were, but unfortunately, my time has just come...

The motives are personal and I don't think it would be very productive to mention them here.

I really do enjoyed working here and I leave behind good friends, which will be sincerely missed.

I really do hope I can come back one day, with a renewed mind and hopefully with more experience in my baggage.

Like the song says:

> May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground, carry on...

Thanks and keep in touch !
